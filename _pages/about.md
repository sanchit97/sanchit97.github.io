Greetings!

I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the [Computer Science department](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) advised by [Dr. Aidong Zhang](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~az9eg/website/lab.html).

Research Areas
======
I am broadly interested in interpretability and robustness of Machine Learning models. I explore all 3 verticals of explainability - local, instance and global. 

Previously, I have been involved around biometric research in facial recognition on human-like faces at [IAB Lab](http://iab-rubric.org/).


Industry Experience
======
In Summer, 2023 I interned at Alexa NLU, Cambridge, MA as an Applied Scientist Intern working on meta-learning based training approaches for LLMs.

In Summer, 2022 I interned at AWS Lex, Sunnyvale, CA as an Applied Scientist Intern working on domain adaptation of large speech models. 

In Summer, 2020 I was a Machine Learning (Perception) Engineering intern at [Unity](https://unity.com/), Seattle, WA in the AI@Unity division where I worked with image tracking and segmentation models for synthetic data.
