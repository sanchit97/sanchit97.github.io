Greetings!

I am a second year PhD student in the [Computer Science department](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/). 

Education
=====

I graduated with my MS in Computer Science from University of Virginia in Spring 2021. My thesis was titled - [
Perturbing Inputs for Fragile Interpretations in Deep NLP](https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/ft848r240)

I completed my undergraduate studies from [IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) where I had opportunity to work at the [IAB Lab](http://iab-rubric.org/) and advised by [Dr. Mayank Vatsa](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~mvatsa/) and [Dr. Richa Singh](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~richa/).

NEWS
======
*November 2022*: Paper accepted to AAAI 2023. See you there!

*October 2022*: I will join Amazon Alexa as an Applied Science Intern in Summer 2023.

*August 2022*: Succesfully completed internship at [AWS Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/).

*December 2021*: I join [Dr. Aidong Zhang](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/aidong-zhang) for future research 

*October 2021*: Paper accepted to [Complex Networks, 2021](https://complexnetworks.org/).

*August 2021*: Paper accepted to [EMNLP'21 BlackBox Workshop](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/).

*May 2021*: Started PhD at UVA CS.


Research Areas
======
I am broadly interested in interpretability and robustness of Machine Learning models. I explore all 3 verticals of explainability - local, instance and global. 

Previously, I have been involved around biometric research in facial recognition on human-like faces at [IAB Lab](http://iab-rubric.org/).

I have been also involved in models to predict epidemiologic events like pest outbreaks, global migration and natural disasters at [Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/).

I have also had smaller assignments exploring medical image segmentation based diagnosis in the [MIDAS Lab at IIITD](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) advised by [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/rajiv-ratn-shah.html).

Industry Experience
======
In Summer, 2022 I interned at AWS Lex, Sunnyvale, CA as an Applied Scientist Intern working on domain adaptation of large speech models. 

In Summer, 2020 I was a Machine Learning (Perception) Engineering intern at [Unity](https://unity.com/), Seattle, WA in the AI@Unity division where I worked with image tracking and segmentation models for synthetic data.

Earlier in Summer, 2018 I was a Software Development Intern at [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com/), Bangalore working in the Client Storage (SSDs) Validation Division.
