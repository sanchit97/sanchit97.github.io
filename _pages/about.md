Greetings!

I am a first year PhD student in the [Computer Science department](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/). 

I am part of the [QData Lab](https://qdata.github.io/qdata-page/) advised by [Dr. Yanjun Qi](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/yanjun/).

I graduated with my Master of Science in Computer Science from University of Virginia in Spring 2021. My thesis was titled - [
Perturbing Inputs for Fragile Interpretations in Deep NLP](https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/ft848r240)

I completed my undergraduate studies from [IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) where I had opportunity to work at the [IAB Lab](http://iab-rubric.org/) and advised by [Dr. Mayank Vatsa](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~mvatsa/) and [Dr. Richa Singh](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~richa/).

Research Areas
======
I am broadly interested in interpretability and robustness of Machine Learning models with a special focus on language models. I am also interested in exploring adversarial attacks on language models. 

Previously, I have been involved around biometric research in facial recognition on human-like faces at [IAB Lab](http://iab-rubric.org/).

I have been also involved in models to predict epidemiologic events like pest outbreaks, global migration and natural disasters at [Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/).

I have also had smaller assignments exploring medical image segmentation based diagnosis in the [MIDAS Lab at IIITD](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) advised by [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/rajiv-ratn-shah.html).

Industry Experience
======

In Summer, 2020 I was a Machine Learning (Perception) Engineering intern at [Unity](https://unity.com/), Seattle, WA in the AI@Unity division where I worked with image tracking and segmentation models for synthetic data.

Earlier in Summer, 2018 I was a Software Development Intern at [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com/), Bangalore working in the Client Storage (SSDs) Validation Division.
